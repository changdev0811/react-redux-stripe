Interface Operator Page:

The Operator will be able to see all the files uploaded by each dentist.
  example:

  search and filter bar (you can search/filter by dentist name, by operator name, by date)
  file 1 - (dentist1) - status successful - date dd/mm/yy -  operator 28

  file 3 - (dentist2) - unsucessfull - date dd/mm/yy -  operator 35

  and so on...

**The Operator will be able to click on a specific file leading to a new route of the file id. 
    Then, the operator will be able to add/edit the status of each file (by default it will always be "in progress").
    The Operator will also be able to add/edit the operator name (by default it will be empty). This feature will be logged, meaning if a new operator takes the file, we will see the previous operator owner.
    The Operator will also be able to add/edit remarks.This feature will be logged and we will be able to see all the remarks.

Basically operator will be able to see the list of all the files uploaded by each dentist with each status, sort them in the main page and update by going inside each file id view.

On the main page of the operators, they will have access to external links and be able to download excel files uploaded by the company.
